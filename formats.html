    <p>Magic: The Gathering offers a wide variety of formats to cater to different playstyles and preferences. Here's an introduction to some of the major formats:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Standard</h2>
            <p>Standard is a rotating format that includes the most recent sets. Decks in Standard can only use cards from the Standard-legal sets. It provides a dynamic and evolving metagame.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Modern</h2>
            <p>Modern is a non-rotating format that includes cards from Eighth Edition forward. It allows for a wide range of deck-building options and features a diverse card pool.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Legacy is a non-rotating format that includes nearly all Magic cards ever printed. It's known for powerful and diverse deck choices and offers a deep and complex metagame.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Commander</h2>
            <p>Commander, also known as Elder Dragon Highlander (EDH), is a casual format where players have a Commander card that leads their deck. Decks are singleton with 100 cards, and the format emphasizes multiplayer gameplay and unique deck-building.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Booster Draft</h2>
            <p>Limited formats, including Draft and Sealed, involve building a deck from a limited pool of cards. In Draft, players pick cards from booster packs, while in Sealed, players use cards from pre-opened packs. These formats test deck-building and adaptability skills.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Pioneer</h2>
            <p>Pioneer is a non-rotating format that includes cards from Return to Ravnica forward. It provides a more recent card pool than Modern and offers a diverse metagame.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Brawl</h2>
            <P>Brawl is a casual format similar to Commander but with a 60-card deck and standard-legal cards only. It's designed for quicker, more accessible games.</P>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Historic</h2>
            <p>Historic is a digital-only format for Magic: The Gathering Arena. It includes cards from various sets, with a focus on digital play and unique digital-only cards.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Pauper</h2>
            <p>Pauper is a format where players can only use common cards. It's known for its affordability and offers a different style of gameplay compared to other formats.</p>
        </li>
