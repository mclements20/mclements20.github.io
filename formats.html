            <h2>Standard</h2>
            <p>Standard is a rotating format that includes the most recent sets. Decks in Standard can only use cards from the Standard-legal sets. This format provides a constantly evolving metagame.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Modern</h2>
            <p>Modern is a non-rotating format that includes cards from Eighth Edition forward. It allows for a wide range of deck-building options and features a diverse card pool.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Legacy is a non-rotating format that includes nearly all Magic cards ever printed. It's known for powerful and diverse deck choices and offers a deep and complex metagame.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Commander</h2>
            <p>Commander, also known as Elder Dragon Highlander (EDH), is a casual format where players have a Commander card that leads their deck. Decks are singleton with 100 cards, and the format emphasizes multiplayer gameplay and unique deck-building.</p>
