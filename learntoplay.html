    <p>Magic: The Gathering is a complex and strategic collectible card game. Here are the basic steps to get started:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Shuffle your deck of cards.</li>
        <li>Draw 7 cards as your starting hand.</li>
        <li>Decide who goes first (usually done by a coin flip).</li>
        <li>Start your turn:</li>
    </ol>

    <section id="Beginning">
        <h2>Beginng Phase</h2>

        <h3>Untap Step</h3>
        <p>The Untap Phase is how you start the turn: Untap all of your permanents on the battlefield.
            This includes your Lands, Creatures, Artifacts etc. As Tapping is one of the cornerstones of MTG gameplay, 
            having them untap means you can use them again.</p>

        <h3>Upkeep Step</h3>
        <p>Once you've done untapping, the next step is the Upkeep Phase. Like its name, the Upkeep Phase is 
            where you pay 'maintenance' costs. In most cases, nothing happens during Upkeep, but there are cards
            with an Upkeep cost. </p>

        <h3>Draw Step</h3>
        <p>This phase is very important as drawing cards gives you more options to play. The Draw Phase lets 
            you draw one card, and only one, unless certain card effects say otherwise.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="Pre-Combat">
        <h3>Pre-Combat Main Phase: aka Main Phase 1</h3>
        <p> The Pre-combat Main Phase is one of two main phases in your turn. The Pre-combat Main Phase is 
            going to take up the majority of the time spent in your turn. It is where 
            you'll likely enact most of your plans and set up for combat.

            At the start of this phase, any effects that trigger at the beginning of the main phase trigger, and 
            you receive priority again. However, this time you are now allowed to play sorcery-speed 
            spells, such as creatures without flash and, of course, Sorceries. You are also allowed to play a 
            land, once per turn.
            
            When all players have done everything they're legally allowed to on the Pre-combat Main Phase, and the 
            stack is empty, the game then moves into the Combat Phase. It is important that you've set up everything
            you need for combat before moving to the next phase, as, again, any unspent mana is removed as you 
            leave your Pre-combat Main Phase.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="Combat">
        <h2>Combat Phase</h2>

        <h3>Declare Attackers</h3>
            <p>In your Declare Attackers Step, you designate which of your untapped creatures are attacking 
                    which opponent.</p>
        <h3>Declare Blockers</h3>
            <p>If at least one of your creatures is attacking and is a valid blockable target, 
                your opponent can declare as many blocking creatures of their own as they like 
                in this step. Blocking doesn't tap the creature down the same way attacking does.</p>

        <h3>Calculate Damamage</h3>
        <p>In this step, all attacking and blocking creatures deal their damage in the way that was assigned
             in the Declare Blockers Step.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="Post-Combat">
        <p>Commonly called the "second main", this phase works identically to the Pre-combat Main Phase. 
            You receive priority and can cast either sorcery — or instant-speed spells. If you didn't play a 
            land in your Pre-combat Main Phase, you can play one now. There are some cards that trigger in the
            Post-combat Main Phase, such as Sphinx of the Second Sun's, or Belbe, Corrupted Observer's.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="End">
        <h2>End Phase</h2>
        <P>This indicated the end of a Players turn</P>

        <h3>End Step</h3>
        <p>Confusingly, the Ending Phase and the End Step are two slightly different things. In the End Step, 
        any "until end of turn" effects end, and any "at the beginning of your End Step" effects trigger. 
        You then gain priority for the final time in your turn — if there is anything you want to do before the 
        start of your turn, the best time to do it is on your opponent's End Step immediately before.</p>
