        <li>Draw 7 cards as your starting hand.</li>
        <li>Decide who goes first (usually done by a coin flip).</li>
        <li>Start your turn:</li>
    </ol>

        <h2>Beginng Phase</h2>

        <h3>Untap Step</h3>
        <p>The Untap Phase is how you start the turn: Untap all of your permanents on the battlefield.
            This includes your Lands, Creatures, Artifacts etc. As Tapping is one of the cornerstones of MTG gameplay, 
            having them untap means you can use them again.</p>

        <h3>Upkeep Step</h3>
        <p>Once you've done untapping, the next step is the Upkeep Phase. Like its name, the Upkeep Phase is 
            where you pay 'maintenance' costs. In most cases, nothing happens during Upkeep, but there are cards
            with an Upkeep cost. </p>

        <h3>Draw Step</h3>
        <p>This phase is very important as drawing cards gives you more options to play. The Draw Phase lets 
            you draw one card, and only one, unless certain card effects say otherwise.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="Pre-Combat">
        <h3>Pre-Combat Main Phase: aka Main Phase 1</h3>
        <p> The Pre-combat Main Phase is one of two phases in your turn that isn't segmented into smaller steps. 
            The Pre-combat Main Phase is going to take up the majority of the time spent in your turn. It is where 
            you'll likely enact most of your plans and set up for combat.

            At the start of this phase, any effects that trigger at the beginning of the main phase trigger, and 
            you receive priority for the third time. However, this time you are allowed to play sorcery-speed 
            spells, such as creatures without flash and, of course, Sorceries. You are also allowed to play a 
            land â€” lands aren't cast and can't be responded to by your opponents, but you can only play 
            one per turn.
            
            When all players have done everything they're legally allowed to on the Pre-combat Main Phase, and the 
            stack is empty, the game then moves into the Combat Phase. It is important that you've set up everything
            you need for combat before moving to the next phase, as, again, any unspent mana is removed as you 
            leave your Pre-combat Main Phase.</p>
